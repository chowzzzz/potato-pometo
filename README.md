Tackling the issue on the new norms of post-COVID-19, Pometo is a virtual team building mobile app aimed for teams who are working from home and facing work lethargy from the lack of physical interactions with their colleagues. Unlike your usual vitual team building applications, Pometo takes a much more friendly and fun approach with the inclusion of features such as a social feed, customizable quizzes and interactive games that you can play with your colleagues. 

The prototype of Pometo was built within 3 days using React Native and Firebase. Our team managed to clinch 3rd place for the DSTA Hackathon! ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥³

This application was written for DSTA BrainHack CODE_EXP Hackathon 2021.
